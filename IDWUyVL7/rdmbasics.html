    <h2>Research Data Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
      Learning goal: Recognise the stages of the research lifecycle and the
      processes involved at each step
    </p>
    <p>
      How we manage data has an impact on the overall quality and integrity of
      our research. Many processes occur throughout the research lifecycle which
      are directly impacted by how we manage our data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding when certain processes occur in the lifecycle can make it
      easier to prepare and plan. Some key aspects of RDM concern the
      organization, documentation, storage, archiving and sharing of research
      data.

    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>
      Below is a diagram which visualizes this lifecycle. Can you determine what
      happens at each stage? Use the drop-down menu to select the appropriate
      answer.

    <!--drop down menu has not been created this will be developed later
    ** To be included in activity: write data management plan, develop informed consent,
    create codebook, create log-book, archive data, create folder structure, etcâ€¦**-->

    <h3>Task 2</h3>
    <p>
      On paper: Think of your own research, can you image what tasks you will
      take on? Write these down and link them to the appropriate steps of the
      lifecycle. Data management plans often reflect this lifecycle,
      understanding the processes which occur at each stage helps with planning

    <h3>End note:</h3>
    <p>Good data management:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Promotes the integrity of your research</li>
      <li>Increases the impact of your research</li>
      <li>Improves the quality of your data</li>
      <li>Supports future use of your research data</li>
      <li>Complies with internal and external regulations</li>
    </ul>
