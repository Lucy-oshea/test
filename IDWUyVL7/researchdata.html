    <h2>Research Data & Data Assets</h2>
    <p>
      Learning goal: Regonise what is a data asset and determine which category
      they fall into
    </p>
    <p>
      When we think of research data we often only consider numerical data,
      however this does not truly reflect the diversity of research data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research data includes all information (physical and digital) collected,
      observed, generated or created for the purpose of analysis, to produce and
      validate original research results. Administrative documentation such as a
      key file, informed consent and interview guides should also be recognized
      as important elements of research data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term ‘Data Asset’ refers to an individual piece of data or
      documentation within a project.
    </p>
    <!--include drop down menu with examples of data assets-->
    <p>
      These data assets go through stages throughout the research lifecycle, and
      with that they can change formats and transform. These transformations
      tend to fall in to three categories. There is a fourth category,
      documentation, this should include any information that brings context and
      understanding to the research data.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Raw data: this is the orginal data collected</li>
      <li>
        Processed data: this has undergone some level of transformation or
        organisation(cleaning, formatting, and structuring of raw data)
      </li>
      <li>
        Analysed data: usually results from statistical motheofs, detailed
        examination, or interpretation of research data
      </li>
      <li>
        Documentation: this is the guides, protocols, documents, and information
        resources which give your data contextual and administrative insight.
        Without this category, your data would not have any instructions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>
      Assign the correct category to the data listed below. Consider what
      processes would be required to create this data asset and evaluate the
      most suitable category.
    </p>
    <!--task 1 functions to be added for now it is just text-->
    <ul>
      <li>Interview guide = ....</li>
      <li>Interview transcript = ....</li>
      <li>Graphs = ....</li>
      <li>Key file = ....</li>
      <li>Audio recording (interview) = ....</li>
      <li>Uncleaned EEG data = ....</li>
      <li>Interview protocol = ....</li>
      <li>Software code = ....</li>
      <li>ReadMe file = ....</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Task 2</h3>
    <p>
      On paper: Think about the data assets you will collect for a research
      project. List these and categorise them. Having a complete list of data
      assets helps in later stages of the data management plan and also gives
      you an overview of your data throughout the entire research lifecycle.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Include the file format what these data assets would be saved in and the approximate size of the files. </li>
        <li>Check out the <a href= "https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/">recommended file formats for research data </a>. It is best to use formats which are openly accessible regardless of what software is available. This increases the accessibility and reusability of your data in the future. </li>
